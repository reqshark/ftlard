### FTL LICENSE. ALL RIGHTS DEALLOCATED.
```bash
FTL LICENSE. ALL RIGHTS DEALLOCATED.

fuck the license ensures all rights in this open source are deallocated
across jurisdictions that recognize copyright.

FTL deallocation is a pervasive extension rendering void all claims
by language or LICENSE in its underlying or dependent subsystem software.
All Rights Deallocated (ARD) is an eternal natural law implicit and expressly
bound to this copy of software alone.

The ARD mechanism was made availble in plain fact and thus herein effected as
a consequence of our timeless pursuit of science and reason
to the benefit and interest of all involved.
